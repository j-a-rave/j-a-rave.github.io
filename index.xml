      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a game developer, software engineer, and all-around pusher of buttons.
My work is mainly in C/C++, with a healthy dose of other languages. I make games and tools for game developers.
I live in the Midwest US, where I grew up. I&amp;rsquo;m an agender person (they/them), a Zen Buddhist, and a hobbyist musician / cook / linguist / all sorts of things.</description>

      <description>Textile Very early work-in-progress. An engine-agnostic framework for systematic narrative games, plus an editor for narrative content. This is my current passion project.
The goal of Textile is to create narrative experiences with nuance, where both writers and players have more agency to make creative choices.
Textile is being developed alongside another personal project, a yet-unannounced narrative game.
Torn Banner Studios I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed here as a Tools Programmer. No details to share just yet!</description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;saints-row-2022&#34;&gt;Saints Row (2022)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first shipped AAA title - I worked on this from pre-production to DLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realtime cinematics system was &lt;em&gt;my baby&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to implementing anything the cinematic artists needed, I also heavily supported the good folks in the lighting, VFX, and audio teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also the sole dedicated accessibility programmer, so I owned features like alternative control methods, blood &amp;amp; gore, subtitles, and some challenge level settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;volitions-ctg-editor&#34;&gt;Volition&amp;rsquo;s CTG Editor&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created and supported a timeline-based scripting editor for cinematic artists, so they could do things like show/hide objects, change the time of day, or load/unload parts of the open world, over the course of a cinematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also owned a few other features relating to object spawners and batch editing game components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;game-jams&#34;&gt;Game Jams&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of games I worked on for a weekend or so.&lt;/p&gt;
