      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a game developer, software engineer, and all-around pusher of buttons.
My work is mainly in C/C++, with a healthy dose of other languages. I make games and tools for game developers.
I live in the Midwest US, where I grew up. I&amp;rsquo;m an agender person (they/them), a Zen Buddhist, and a hobbyist musician / cook / linguist / all sorts of things.</description>

      <description>Professional Spry Fox - ??? Torn Banner - Various Tools Mainly, I created and supported a proprietary tool called Submit Helper, a custom P4V tool designed to kick off preflight builds, manage Jira tickets, open/close code reviews, and anything else needed before things got tossed into the depot.
I also supported tool needs for animators, created a framework for building automated tests in UE5, and a few other things.
Volition - Saints Row (2022) My first shipped AAA title - I worked on this from pre-production to DLC.</description>

&lt;h4 id=&#34;volition---saints-row-2022&#34;&gt;Volition - Saints Row (2022)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first shipped AAA title - I worked on this from pre-production to DLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realtime cinematics system was &lt;em&gt;my baby&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to implementing anything the cinematic artists needed, I also heavily supported the good folks in the lighting, VFX, and audio teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also the sole dedicated accessibility programmer, so I owned features like alternative control methods, blood &amp;amp; gore, subtitles, and some challenge level settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;volition---ctg-editor&#34;&gt;Volition - CTG Editor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created and supported a timeline-based scripting editor for cinematic artists, so they could do things like show/hide objects, change the time of day, or load/unload parts of the open world, over the course of a cinematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also owned a few other features relating to object spawners and batch editing game components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;personal&#34;&gt;Personal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;textile&#34;&gt;Textile&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Very early work-in-progress.&lt;/em&gt; An engine-agnostic framework for systemic narrative games, plus an editor for narrative content. This is my current passion project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Textile is to create narrative experiences with nuance, where both writers and players have more agency to make creative choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textile is being developed alongside another personal project, a yet-unannounced narrative game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;game-jams&#34;&gt;Game Jams&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of games I worked on for a weekend or so.&lt;/p&gt;
