<h1 id="dialogue-trees-would-be-a-wild-way-to-speak-to-another-human-being">Dialogue trees would be a wild way to speak to another human being.<a href="#dialogue-trees-would-be-a-wild-way-to-speak-to-another-human-being" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>And yet, they&rsquo;re ubiquitous in the world of video games.</p>
<p>They give the player ultimate agency over the information given in an interaction. The best dialogue systems in this style make it clear when a given option will move the conversation forward and give the player necessary information, or when it will give the player additional non-vital details.</p>
<p>Players need to buy in and voluntarily get more out of a conversation, or otherwise can breeze through an interaction and get back to the gameplay.</p>
<h1 id="how-can-we-do-better">How can we do better?<a href="#how-can-we-do-better" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>When conversation <em>is</em> gameplay, simply following the heuristic isn&rsquo;t nearly good enough.</p>
<p>In a visual novel, roleplaying game, or social deduction game, some of the most important gameplay revolves around speaking to the game&rsquo;s characters. More importantly, <em>listening</em> to them. But we&rsquo;re still stuck on the rails.</p>
<p>The trick is to move away from the idea of dialogue, and toward conversation.</p>
<h1 id="whats-the-difference">What&rsquo;s the difference?<a href="#whats-the-difference" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Dialogue is performance. It exists for the benefit of an audience. Using a typical dialog tree, the player might be able to direct how much of a dialogue they see, or whether they see the &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; version of the dialogue, but regardless they&rsquo;ll be fed similar information.</p>
<p>Conversation is a living thing. It exists for the benefit of its participants. In this case, both the player and the NPC would exchange information. What a character knows will be affected by what the player divulges, and vice versa.</p>
<h1 id="so-no-dialogue">So, no dialogue?<a href="#so-no-dialogue" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Yes dialogue! But in Textile, we must make a distinction.</p>
<p>Conversation: Interaction between the player and one or more characters, driven systemically by character knowledge and motivation as well as player input. Mushroom and/or venom writing, per Emily Short.</p>
<p>Dialogue: Written exchange between two or more characters. Highly curated or non-generated; beeswax writing, per Emily Short.</p>
